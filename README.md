# MFE_distributions
Modeling MFE in influenza

Hypothesis: Flu has a different MFE distribution than other viruses 

1.	Compare flu MFE distribution to other distributions
a.	Table 4:
b.	Kurtosis, skew, KS test
i.	With lethal fraction
ii.	Without lethal fraction
1.	Flu: HA+NA
2.	All
Figure:
	Overlay all distributions, lines for each virus 
	And separately

2.	Compare flu MFE to known distributions
a.	Table x
i.	Fit Flu All + HA/NA distributions to known distributions
1.	Gamma
2.	Beta
3.	Weibull 
4.	Exponential
5.	Log-normal
6.	1-5 + uniform

3.	pick one with best fit
a.	use goodness of fit test to test all viruses from other papers against that distribution.
i.	Pick goodness of fit test based on distribution for flu
1.	this should agree with part 1 (same or different sample distributions with K.S. Test)
